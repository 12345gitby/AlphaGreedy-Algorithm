# AlphaGreedy Algorithm for Fair Regret Minimization

## Overview

AlphaGreedy is a Java implementation of an algorithm that solves the Fair Regret Minimization problem, which is equivalent to the Constrained Set Cover problem in computer science. 
This algorithm aims to find a subset of points (or sets) from a dataset that minimizes regret under fairness constraints defined by group coverage requirements.

```

The program will output the result set \( S \) that minimizes regret under the given fairness constraints.

## Algorithm Details
Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the AlphaGreedy algorithm and its implementation details

AlphaGreedy is designed to solve the Fair Regret Minimization problem, which is akin to the Constrained Set Cover problem in computer science.
Here's a breakdown of the algorithm's approach and key components:

### Approach

1. **Layer-Based Selection**: AlphaGreedy adopts a layer-based approach to efficiently select subsets (sets of integers) from a given dataset \( D \) while respecting fairness constraints defined by group coverage requirements \( |S \cap G_i| = k_i \).

2. **Binary Search for Fairness Threshold**: The algorithm uses a binary search strategy to find an optimal fairness threshold \( \epsilon \). This threshold determines the maximum regret ratio allowed for including elements in subsets \( S \).

3. **Set System Construction**: The set system \( \Sigma = (D, F) \) is constructed based on regret ratios and the current threshold \( \epsilon \). Each subset \( P \in D \) is formed by including utility functions \( f_j \) that have a regret ratio \( \text{rr}_D(p_i, f_j) \leq \epsilon \).

4. **Solver for Constrained Set Cover**: The core of the algorithm is the `solver` function, which solves the constrained set cover problem:
   - **Initialization**: Initialize an empty result set \( S \) and a covered set \( C \).
   - **Layer Assignment**: Assign each subset \( P_i \in D \) to a specific layer \( L(t) \) based on its size \( |P_i| \), where \( t \) is determined by \( \alpha \), a scaling factor.
   - **Top-Down Processing**: Process layers from the highest to the lowest \( t \):
     - For each subset \( P_i \) in layer \( L(t) \), check if it can be added to \( S \):
       - Ensure adding \( P_i \) does not violate fairness constraints or exceed coverage limits.
       - Update \( S \) and \( C \) accordingly.
     - Adjust subset \( P_i \)'s layer assignment based on its ability to cover additional elements.
   - **Termination**: Stop processing layers when all subsets have been processed or \( C \) covers all elements in \( F \).

5. **Fairness Check**: After constructing \( S \), ensure each group \( G_i \) meets its coverage requirements \( k_i \). If not, adjust \( S \) by adding elements from \( G_i \) until the requirement is met.

### Implementation

- **AlphaGreedy.java**: Contains the main algorithm implementation, including the `main` method for execution and coordination with other components.
  
- **Solver Function**: Implements the constrained set cover problem by processing layers and subsets according to the described algorithmic approach. It ensures that subsets are selected or adjusted based on their ability to cover elements while adhering to fairness constraints.

- **ConstructSetSystem Function**: Constructs the set system \( \Sigma \) based on regret ratios and the current threshold \( \epsilon \).

- **RegretRatio Function**: Calculates the regret ratio for including elements in subsets, which is pivotal in determining subset inclusion based on \( \epsilon \).

- **Helper Functions**: Includes utility functions like `anyGroupExceedsLimit`, used for constraint validation during the solver process.

### Example Usage

Here's how you can use the AlphaGreedy algorithm in practice:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<Set<Integer>> D = Arrays.asList(
        new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 6, 3)),
        new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(2, 6, 4, 5)),
        new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(4, 5))
    );

    Set<Integer> F = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6));

    List<Set<Integer>> G = Arrays.asList(
        new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2)),
        new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(3, 4)),
        new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(5, 6)),
        new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(5))
    );

    int[] k = {1, 1, 1, 1};
    double alpha = 1.1;
    double xi = 0.01;

    Set<Integer> result = alphaGreedy(D, F, G, k, alpha, xi);
    System.out.println("Result set S: " + result);
}
```

### Conclusion

AlphaGreedy provides an efficient solution to the Fair Regret Minimization problem by leveraging a layer-based approach and binary search for threshold determination. It balances computational efficiency with optimal subset selection under fairness constraints, 
making it suitable for various applications in decision-making and optimization scenarios.
